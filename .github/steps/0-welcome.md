# Welcome to the CI/CD Pipeline Course

In this course, you will learn how to create a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This pipeline will:
- Run unit tests on each commit.
- Automate the build and deployment of a web application on GitHub Pages.
- Send Discord notifications if something goes wrong.

Let's get started!
